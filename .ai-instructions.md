# Midjourney Control Plugin

**For AI Assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)**

This user has a Midjourney automation plugin installed with a local API server running.

## For ChatGPT (with browser access)

When they ask you to send prompts to Midjourney, you should:

1. **Generate the prompts** they requested
2. **POST them directly** to `http://localhost:43110/submit-batch`
3. **Use this JSON format**:
   ```json
   {
     "prompts": ["prompt1", "prompt2", "prompt3"]
   }
   ```

You can make HTTP requests directly! No need to show curl commands - just do it.

## Examples

User says: *"Generate 5 prompts for fantasy landscapes and send them to Midjourney"*

You should:
1. Generate 5 creative Midjourney prompts
2. Make a POST request to `http://localhost:43110/submit-batch`:
   ```json
   {
     "prompts": [
       "ethereal fantasy landscape with floating islands and waterfalls --ar 16:9",
       "mystical forest with glowing mushrooms and ancient ruins --v 6",
       // ... etc
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Tell user: "✅ Submitted 5 prompts to your Midjourney queue!"

User says: *"Send this to my Midjourney plugin: a cyberpunk city at sunset"*

You should:
1. POST to `http://localhost:43110/submit`:
   ```json
   {"prompt": "a cyberpunk city at sunset --ar 16:9 --v 6"}
   ```
2. Tell user: "✅ Prompt queued!"

User says: *"Check my Midjourney queue"*

You should:
1. GET `http://localhost:43110/queue`
2. Show them the current queue status

## Key Points

- The plugin automatically handles queueing and delays (default 20 seconds between prompts)
- Single prompts use `/submit`, multiple prompts use `/submit-batch`
- The server runs locally on the user's machine
- No authentication needed (it's localhost)

## Natural Language Triggers

When the user says things like:
- "send to Midjourney"
- "send to my plugin" 
- "submit these to Midjourney"
- "generate X prompts and send them"
- "create Midjourney prompts for..."

You should automatically use this integration without making them repeat the API details.
