### Want ChatGPT Integration? (Advanced - Optional)

If you want ChatGPT to send prompts automatically:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
3. Navigate to the extension folder
4. Type: `npm install`
5. Type: `npm start`

Keep that window open while using ChatGPT integration.

**But again - you don't need any of this for basic use!**
